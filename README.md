    <p class="col-md-6 row";>The Project starts with an object. Initially we needed to sketch the object for 100 times. The object I chose was an ice cream scoop. The sketch is tedious because it required 100 of them, but I managed to finish it. </p>

    <div class="col-md-4">    
    <p class="col-md-6 row"; >The second section required me to simplify the objectâ€™s shade and detail into a simple shape. The shape itself should as accurate and consistent. In another word, it needs to be able to identify with same object as original. It is hard to make because there are so many details that I wanted to remain or feel inappropriate to leave behind hence, the result is not as satisfying as it was. </p>

    <img src="0003.jpg" alt="Step Three" style="height:auto;width:100%;">
    <p class="col-md-6 row">The third and final part is to make it interact with the object to define the usage of the object as minimalistic as possible. This is hardest part. I had to consider the distance between the object and other objects to make it understandable. I did not make it perfectly. </p>
